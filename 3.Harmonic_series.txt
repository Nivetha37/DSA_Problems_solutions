What is the time complexity of this code?


for i = 1 to n
    j = 0
    while j < n:
        j += i 
        print(i + j)


Explanation:


ANSWER: O(n*log(n))
* The outer loop runs n times i.e O(n) time complexity.
* The inner loop runs from 1 to the sum of numbers from 1 to n.
*  for the first iteration, the inner while loop runs n/1 times.
*  for the second iteration , the inner while loop runs n/2 times.
* it continues till the loop ends..
This series resembles the harmonic series, which sums to approximately O(log(n)).
Hence, the overall time complexity of the code is  O(n*log(n)).
