What is the time complexity of this code?


i = 1
while i * i <= n:
    print(i)
    i += 1


i = 1
while i <= n:
    print(i)
    i *= 2


Explanation:


* Time complexity of the 1st loop is O(sqrt(n)).
* Time complexity of the 2nd loop is O(log(n)).
* Among sqrt(n) and log(n), sqrt(n) is the bigger factor. That's why it is considered in the final time complexity.
